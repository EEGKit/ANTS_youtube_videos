# Code accompanying ANTS (analyzing neural time series data) YouTube lectures. 

Each folder here corresponds to one of the playlists on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUR_LsXk7IYyueSnXcNextQ

## How to use these code files
Go to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUR_LsXk7IYyueSnXcNextQ) and look for the playlists called "OLD ANTS #x)". The files used in those videos are inside the folder here with the corresponding name. (The file called sampleEEGdata.mat is used in many sections and is in the main directory.)
### About these lectures
These recordings were my first attempts at filming educational videos at home (most were recorded in 2015). The audiovisual quality is shamefully, embarrassingly crappy. I had a cheap setup and didn't know what I was doing. And the font size of the code is too small.

But the content is fine and many people have told me that they don't mind the poor A/V quality, so the videos are still here!

My home recording setup now is way better, and near-professional level, so please also check out my other YT videos. You can find a full list of my online courses (ahem, all with high-quality recordings :P  ) at http://sincxpress.com/.
